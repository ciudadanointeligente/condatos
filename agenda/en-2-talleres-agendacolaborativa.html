<p>The objective of this session is to help build an Open Data agenda for the region, answering the following questions: What is the role of Open Data in socioeconomic development and transparency in Latin America? What are the main characteristics of Open Data policies and how should they be defined? How do we ensure that the rights of people such as privacy are respected? How to promote collaborative development practices in civic projects and what are the rules? What kind of technological infrastructure is needed by States and citizens to support these projects in Latin America? How do the most vulnerable groups in our societies benefit from Open Data? What new skills and responsibilities must we promote to include them? A base document for answering these questions will be published online. At the end of ConDatos a document with the conclusions of this session will be presented. </p>
