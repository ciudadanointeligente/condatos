<p>One of the great promises around Open Data is the economic spillover they will bring. There are still few examples of the 3 trillion dollars in annual economic value Open Data is supposed to generate. This panel seeks to open up the discussion on where opportunities lie for entrepreneurs that are working to generate this value and which are the main challenges they will face in the coming years. The panelists, with experience from the trenches, will bring an ambitious yet realistic vision of the future in the use of Open Data.</p>
