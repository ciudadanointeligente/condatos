<h6>Caribbean Open Institute</h6><br>
<p>This panel will discuss some of the insights gained from various practical demand-side Open Data initiatives within the Caribbean including the need for intermediaries to play a significant role as catalysts and enablers of Open Data initiative. It will also look into the importance of an Open Data agenda based on increased efficiency of public service and entrepreneurial activity vs transparency/accountability. Finally, it will enquire on the importance of common technological platforms, tools, standards and code repositories for shared use across countries and the use of innovation fellowships as models of engagements between Governments and Civil Society.</p>
