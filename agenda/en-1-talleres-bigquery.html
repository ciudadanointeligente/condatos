<h3>Google BigQuery for Open Data</h3>
<h3>Google</h3><br>
<h4>October 1 from 1600 - 1900</h4><br>
<p>Its objective is to showcase two projects of Open Data use developed by Google. The first is BigQuery, a service that allows mass analysis of large volumes of data, using the processing power of Google's infrastructure. The second is The GDELT Project, a real-time database of global society for open research. At the end, a workshop will be held focusing on teaching the participants how to implement projects of this magnitude, using tools to scale databases and to work with governments as they open their data.</p>
